# Blocked Numbers

I get annoying spam calls a few times a day. I installed [True Caller](https://www.truecaller.com/) which does a decent job, but it still misses the other 800 numbers I have blocked. Most of these numbers look almost exactly like my phone number, but they are usually 1 digit off. 

This repo will serve as a global repository of numbers that should be blocked. I'm not talking about your crazy Ex's number, but numbers like the robo calls that say "Hi, this is Lisa, can you hear me ok? (silience.....)". 

This repo comes with a generator to generate a [vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard). Just ruby `ruby generator.rb`, and take the vcard, then import in to your contacts. Then you can block that SPAM contact.

If you have some numbers that are not in this list, please submit an issue.
